## Hi there, it's me 👋

This organization is an experiment: to collaborate with others and to bootstrap my own setup with Terrafrom, Terragrunt, K8s, Helm, Helmfile and many more interesting technologies.

For my personal projects checkout my personal GitHub profile [nicojahn](https://github.com/nicojahn)!
